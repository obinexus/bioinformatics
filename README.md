# Bioinformatics: When Entropy Degrades Systems, We Rebuild Its Foundation

> **"When entropy degrades systems, we rebuild its foundation/infrasture with bioinformatics."**

## Overview

**Bioinformatics** is a sparse, sustainable information framework where **bioinformation** represents all data aligned with a universal biological model. It enables both passive (intuitive) and active (observer-to-consumer) processing of infinite information streams, ensuring flexibility and resilience in real-world systems.

This repository implements **sparse-exit**, a Hamiltonian-path engine over Bloom-filtered graphs, designed for:
- Neurodivergent R&D and autism care pathways
- k-mer genome assembly
- Energy-aware wireless systems
- Perceptual membrane modeling

## Core Philosophy

- **Bioinformation**: All data aligned with biological models - from DNA to human-centric wireless waves
- **Sparse Structure**: Local/non-local maxima & minima without dense computation
- **Perspective Membrane**: Safe, permeable cognitive bubble shielding intuition while allowing curiosity
- **Observer → Consumer Model**: Passive listening → active use with dual-panic error recovery
- **95.4% Persistence**: Information survives degradation, panic, and entropy

## Real-World Applications

### Radio Waves → Rent Money: The Invisible Spectrum
Human-centric wireless charging (6G/7G) using energy waves at different frequencies:
```
[Radio] → [Microwave] → [Infrared] → [Visible] → [Gamma/X-ray]
```
Biological operation must remain stable under naked-eye dangers that can kill.

### Blue Share Protocol (Energy-as-Information)
Decentralized, peer-to-peer info-energy relay with:
- QFT contracts between local & non-local states
- Fail-safe mode + on-the-fly node updates
- Natural system stability (centurion-grade)

### Emergency Safety & Home Tech
Critical need (not want) in emergency safety fields:
- 6G/7G must DO THE JOB - not leave users vulnerable
- Wireless Bluetooth modes mitigate wave-induced degradation
- Perceptive membrane as biological firewall

## Sparse-Exit Engine

```bash
./sparse_exit.py hints.bin partial.json
```

Features:
- 128-byte Bloom filter edge whitelist (pre-conscious filter)
- Greedy DFS for longest Hamiltonian-ish path
- Cycle closure when back-edge exists

Used for:
- Puppet-anchor transitions
- Care pathway reconstruction  
- k-mer contig assembly
- Energy-wave routing

## Dual-Panic Recovery

1. Entropy hits → degradation
2. System panics → go to previous state
3. Actor model → handle exception
4. Recover → next stable state

> "If it is experience, it is exception. If it is exception, it is recoverable."

## Goals of Biological Information

- Ecosystem sustainability
- Active coherence
- Evolution of infrastructure  
- 95.4% information persistence
- Sparse execution under entropy

## Installation & Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/obinexus/bioinformatics.git
cd V_MVP/
chmod +x sparse_exit.py
```

### Smoke Test
```bash
echo '{"0":[1,2],"1":[0,3],"2":[0,3],"3":[1,2,4],"4":[3]}' > partial.json
python3 -c "import hashlib; bf=bytearray(128); ... " > hints.bin  # (see script)
./sparse_exit.py hints.bin partial.json
# → 0 1 3 4 (or cycle: 0 1 3 4 0)
```
